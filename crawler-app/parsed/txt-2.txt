Citroën C2

The Citroën C3 is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by Citroën since April 2002. It replaced the Citroën Saxo in the model line up, and is currently in its fourth generation. Initial models of the Citroën C3 were built using the same platform as the Peugeot 206. The third generation model was released in January 2017, and has been developed alongside the Peugeot 208 since 2019.

The C3 is produced in a five-door hatchback body style, with the first generation also being produced in a two-door convertible version, called the C3 Pluriel. A three-door hatchback, with a similar design as the second generation, was available as the Citroën DS3 and marketed as a premium model.[1][2]

A mini MPV derivative of the C3 was announced in July 2008, called the C3 Picasso. In South America, a mini SUV version called the C3 Aircross, was produced and marketed only locally.

In September 2021, a new, low-cost model was introduced for the Indian and South American markets. During its introduction, Citroën CEO Vincent Cobée mentioned that the "C3" is the trade name for all Citroën B-segment hatchbacks around the world.[3] This model was extensively modified and upgraded for the European market as the fourth-generation C3, which was introduced in October 2023. The third and fourth-generation C3 are available with a battery electric variant.

Interior

After Jean-Pierre Ploué was appointed Director of the Citroën Design Center in 2000, he designed the C3 under the leadership of Donato Coco, who was already responsible for Citroën Xsara Picasso.[5]

The first generation of the C3 was launched at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, as well as the 2001 Bologna Motor Show, and began marketing in January 2002,[6] as a five-door hatchback. It was available with 1.1, 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol engines, and 1.4 and 1.6 litre common rail diesel engines. All models came as standard with a five speed manual transmission, except for the Stop & Start model, which came with the SensoDrive gearbox,[7] a five-speed automated manual transmission with paddle-shifters and manual and automatic modes. The top level was the only version that had the option of a four-speed hydraulic automatic transmission.[8][9]

In accordance with the PSA Group policy, the C3's chassis was used for the Peugeot 1007 and the Peugeot 207. Many components of the C3 are the same as those of the Peugeot 206. Some versions of the C3 feature a start-stop system that can automatically cut the engine when not needed to save fuel, such as in traffic, and restart it briskly to move on again. The vehicle was loosely styled after the Citroën 2CV.

An offroad-looking model called C3 X-TR was marketed from 2005 to 2009.[10]

The Citroën C3 Lumiere was a concept car that previewed the production Citroën C3, it was initially released in 1998 as a five-door hatchback, with four seats and rear suicide doors for easy access for passengers to the rear seats. It featured a five-speed manual transmission, and a 1.1 L TU1 I4 petrol engine upfront.

Safety[edit]

The C3 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for pedestrians from Euro NCAP in 2002.[11]

Facelift[edit]

The C3 was given a redesign in October 2005, with the front end featuring a more imposing bumper, wider lower air intake, single air intake slit below the restyled radiator grille, and a repositioned number plate. The rear of the car was also given redesigned light clusters, with crystal coloured midsections.

The passenger compartment was also enhanced, with the fitting of a restyled dashboard with a high-quality finish, as well as a newer, more modern instrument cluster making the driver information easier to read.

The addition of light metallic grey embellishers around the central section of the fascia and air vents contributed to the updated interior, as did the completely redesigned front and rear door panels and trims. The steering was also improved so that it stiffens up with speed. Citroën also added a new 1.6 L 16 valve HDi diesel engine to the range, rated at 81 kW (110 PS). The Pluriel also received similar interior alterations but was otherwise unchanged.

As with the Peugeot 206+ and Renault Clio Campus, Citroën didn't yet end the original C3 despite the new generation arrival. It stayed offered on selected European markets. During Autumn 2009, the brand announces the first-gen C3 will be marketed under a new name : Citroën C3 Génération.[12] However, a few weeks later, the name is changed to Citroën C3 Classic. This name is used in France but also in other countries like Greece or Italy. Various names are used across Europe like C3 Hit Classic (Belgium), C3 First (UK, Germany) or C3 First+ (Switzerland).[13][14][15][16] The first-gen C3 was manufactured in Spain until 2010, in France until Summer 2011 and sold across Europe until February 2011.[17]

The South-American model was manufactured and sold until 2012.[18]

C3 Pluriel[edit]

Citroën marketed the C3 Pluriel from 2003 to 2010 as a convertible with five open top variations, hence the name.[19] The name Pluriel is a cognate with the English plural. This model was developed as a turnkey project by Italdesign.[20] It was exclusively assembled in Spain.

The Pluriel can be configured as a hatchback with a multi-layer insulated top;[21] a full-length landaulet, operable partially or to the back window or any stage in between, with a buffet minimizing wind deflector over the windshield;[21] a fixed profile convertible, with the roof open to the back window, the roof assembly folds into a well in the trunk floor;[21] a full convertible where roof side rails are unlatched and removed.[21] and as a roadster pick up, where the back seats fold to a pickup like bed with a drop-down tailgate.[21] The roof tended to let in water, even from new.[22]

The C3 Pluriel was introduced in July 2003, and was originally offered with a choice of a 1.4 or a 1.6 L petrol engine, and a 1.4 L[23] diesel engine. The 1.6 L petrol came fitted, as standard, with an automated manual gearbox. The Pluriel was withdrawn in July 2010.

In October 2013, Top Gear Magazine placed the C3 Pluriel on its list of "The 13 worst cars of the last 20 years", describing the car as "useful as a chocolate teapot."[24]

South America[edit]

The first generation C3 was manufactured in the Porto Real PSA plant from 2003 to August 2012.[18] This version was sold locally and also exported to other Mercosur markets. The South American C3 significantly differentiated itself from its European counterpart in 2008 when it got a facelift, including exclusive front bumpers.[25][26]

A limited number of CKD Citroën C3 have been assembled in Uruguay by local assembler Oferol.[27]

Interior

The second generation of the C3 was revealed in June 2009,[28] and made its official debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009.[29] It features a new body design, with a 108 degree field of vision windscreen, similar to the one of the larger C4 Picasso, which is available on all versions, except the entry model VT.[citation needed]

The new C3 builds on the curvy profile of the previous model and has a look in keeping with other Citroën models and the older C3, although it is longer and wider than the old model. The lights at the front, bonnet, dashboard assembly, and other components are shared with the DS3.

On the new C3, the instrumentation is a mix of analogue dials beneath a styled cowl and a digital display for the fuel and trip computer. There is no temperature gauge (unlike the DS3), but a red and blue warning lamp to show hot or cold engines which come on as required. The drag coefficient is 0.307 Cd.

In engineering terms, the PSA TU powerplants are carried over from the old car and Citroën also announced a new range of small petrol engines that PSA Peugeot Citroën developed in partnership with BMW. These "Prince" engines have double overhead 16 valve camshafts, on-demand oil and water pumps, and BMW's patent injection and ignition technology.

They are designed for low CO2 emissions and for good performance and economy. The economy was improved by the standard-fit cruise control and speed limiter available on the VTR+, Airdream+, and Exclusive models.

All versions have a standard fit "Gear Efficiency Indicator" which graphically states what gear to be in and when to change up to optimise economy. They come in 1.4 L 70 kW (95 PS) and 1.6 L 88 kW (120 PS) versions with low emissions, as well as new diesel engines, all with CO2 emissions of under 120 g/km, plus an "Airdream+" model with 99 g/km using a new 1.6 HDI 66 kW (90 PS) engine.

The New C3 was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009. It was launched in November 2009, as a 2010 model. Across Europe, the advertising slogan was known as "The Visiospace", playing on the merit of the large windscreen and the improved vision afforded.

Facelift[edit]
Facelift Citroën C3, European version

Launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2013, the C3 hatchback was revised to featuring updated exterior and interior, and more efficient engines. The C3 facelift comes with updated chevrons and bumper-mounted LED daytime running lights at the front and new tail light clusters combined with new reflectors set underneath the rear bumper.[30]

Safety[edit]

The C3 in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2015.[31]

The C3 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2009.[32]

Variants[edit]

There are four trim levels in the C3 range, which range from the entry-level VT (which does not have the panoramic windscreen), the mid-range VTR+ and eco-efficient "Airdream+" (which has lower CO2 emissions) to the top of the range Exclusive, which has half cloth half Alcantara seats, extra chrome outside, alloy wheels, an alarm, folding mirrors, and power windows all around.

Trim levels are denoted by a small badge on the rear window frame on the VT/VTR+ and Airdream+ and by a small chrome badge on each front door on Exclusive models. Norev has produced a 1:43 scale model of the new Citroën C3 in Botticelli Blue, Metallic Green, and black.

The European market fourth-generation C3 was introduced on 17 October 2023 and produced in 2024.[42] The model is based on the Smart Car Platform, which will underpin 7 models produced by Stellantis in the future. It is described as a more efficient alternative to other STLA modular architectures with focus on battery electric models.[43]

Compared to the Indian market C3, the European version C3 features C-shaped LED headlights, an enclosed grille that features Citroën's new logo, triple element LED DRLs, distinct front fenders and door designs, conventional grab door handles, different taillights, a different rear bumper design and the option of larger alloy wheels.[44] The C3 is the first model to feature Citroën's new design language and new logo, which were both previewed by the Oli Concept in 2022.[45]

For the interior, the European version C3 features a layered dashboard layout, opposed to the Indian-market C3 which has an older interior layout with basic controls.[44] It features the C-Zen Lounge concept with Citroën's Heads Up Display (which replaces the traditional instrument cluster) and a flat bottom design steering wheel.[46]

For the first time in history, the C3 is equipped with Citroën Advanced Comfort® Suspension along with new Citroën Advanced Comfort® Seats.[46]

The design of the fourth-generation C3 resembles crossover SUVs, with a 163 mm (6.4 in) ground clearance, 28 mm (1.1 in) higher than its predecessor. The C3 also features a higher roof line, which creates a larger cabin with 30 mm (1.2 in) additional front headroom and 20 mm (0.8 in) of added rear knee room, despite being only 19 mm (0.7 in) longer and 6 mm (0.2 in) wider.[47]

The ë-C3 is equipped with a 44 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery capable of an electric range of up to 320 km (199 mi) measured by the WLTP cycle. The 83 kW (113 PS; 111 hp) electric motor allows the vehicle to reach 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in around 11 seconds.[46]

The third generation C3 for Indian and Latin American markets was released on 16 September 2021 and produced since 2022.[50][51] Produced in Brazil and India, the model has been described by Citroën as a "modern hatchback", avoiding the "crossover SUV" branding.[52]

The exterior has crossover SUV styling with its high ground clearance, high bonnet, roof rails and black cladding. There are split headlights connected to Citroen’s double-slat grill, the option of orange accents on the front bumper and side cladding, an upright rear hatch door and rectangular LED taillights.[50]

The interior has a 250 mm (10 in) touchscreen infotainment system, a dimpled-effect on the dashboard panel, a raised driving position and the colour of the dashboard and seat fabrics can be customised.[50]

In India, the C3 is praised for its dynamic qualities, but receives persistent criticism for the lack of equipment offered on the model.[53][54] As a result of this criticism, Citroën revised its offering in this market in August 2024, adding automatic climate control, a new instrument cluster inherited from the Citroën C3 Aircross and Citroën Basalt, and 6 airbags as standard.[55]

ë-C3[edit]

In January 2023, Citroën unveiled the all-electric ë-C3 in India with a 42 kW (57 PS; 56 hp) electric motor, a 29.2 kWh battery and a range of 320 km (199 mi). The ë-C3 has blue 'ë' badges on the front doors, a charging port on front fender, the omission of a tailpipe and the only interior difference is a selector switch instead of a gear knob compared to the regular C3.[56]

The Indian version of the ë-C3 received 0 stars for adults and 1 star for toddlers from Global NCAP in 2024 (based on Latin NCAP 2016).[57]

Markets[edit]
Argentina[edit]

The third-generation C3 was launched in 24 October 2022 with four trim levels: Live, Live Pack, Feel and Feel Pack. Two engine options are available: a EB2F 1.2-litre PureTech petrol with 60 kW (82 PS; 80 hp) and a 1.6-litre Flex Fuel petrol. At launch, there was a First Edition model limited at 1,200 units, it is distinguished by "First Edition" exterior badges.[58]

Brazil[edit]

The third-generation C3 was launched in Brazil with four trim levels: Live, Live Pack, Feel and Feel Pack. Two engine options are available: a 1.0-litre FireFly petrol by Fiat and a 1.6-litre Flex Fuel petrol. At launch, there was a First Edition model available.[59]

Since 2023, the Brazilian-made C3 has been exported outside of Mercosur, in several Latin America countries such as Chile, Peru and Costa Rica.[60][61][62]

In August 2024, the C3 YOU! version was introduced in Brazil with a Fiat 1.0L turbo engine and CVT.[63]

India[edit]

The third-generation C3 was launched in India on 20 July 2022, with two trim levels: Live and Feel. Two engine options are available: a EB2F 1.2-litre PureTech petrol with 60 kW (82 PS; 80 hp) and a EB2DT 1.2-litre PureTech turbocharged petrol with 81 kW (110 PS; 109 hp).[64] The Shine trim was later added in April 2023.[65]

The Indian-made C3 uses 90% local parts and began exports to ASEAN markets on 31 March 2023.[66][67]

The ë-C3 was launched in India on 27 February 2023, with two trim levels: Live and Feel.[68] The Shine trim for the ë-C3 was later added in January 2024.[69]

Indonesia[edit]

The third-generation C3 was launched in Indonesia on 7 December 2022, as part of Citroën's return to Indonesia. In Indonesia, the C3 is powered by a EB2F 1.2-litre PureTech petrol with 60 kW (82 PS; 80 hp), only available with a 5-speed manual, comes in standard and Plus variants.[70]

The ë-C3 was introduced to Indonesia at the 30th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2023.[71] The first 500 units of the ë-C3 destined for the Indonesian market commenced imports in April 2024.[72]

South Africa[edit]

The third-generation C3 was launched in South Africa on 25 May 2023 in a sole Feel trim, powered by a EB2F 1.2-litre PureTech petrol with 60 kW (82 PS; 80 hp).[73] The Max trim (positioned above the Feel trim) was later added in March 2024.[74]

Safety[edit]
India[edit]

In India, the C3 is fitted with two frontal airbags, anti-lock brakes, seatbelt reminders for front-seat occupants and speed alerts at 80 km/h and 120 km/h as required by Indian AIS safety regulations. Side airbags for the thorax or head are not available, and neither are electronic stability control or a tyre pressure monitor. The rear centre seatbelt is of a dangerous static two-point type and this seating position is not fitted with a head restraint. The rear outboard head restraints are not adjustable. There are no ISOFIX anchorages for child restraints.[75] Although the C3 complies with Indian crashworthiness legislation, it has not been rated by independent consumer testing programmes like Global NCAP.

In February 2024, Citroën India announced that all variants of the Indian C3 would be fitted with six airbags and rear seatbelt reminders by July of the same year.[76]

Latin America[edit]

In Brazil, the C3 is fitted with two frontal airbags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, seatbelt reminders for the front seats, ISOFIX anchorages at the rear outboard seats, and adjustable head restraints and three-point inertia-reel seatbelts for all rear seats.[77] It had been tested by Latin NCAP in 2023 (similar to Euro NCAP 2014) and received 0 star because of unstable structure, weak frontal crash protection, lack of lateral head protection and lack of seatbelt reminder.[78][79]
